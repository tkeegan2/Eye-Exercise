# Eye-Exercise

## Description

The Eyes Exercise is a JavaScript application that animates a pair of eyes that follow a mouse cursor as it moves across a screen.  This was a great exercise for me to practice DOM manipulation.

## Features

- The eyes smoothly follow the cursor movement on the screen.
- The eyes' position updates in real-time, creating a natural "eye-tracking" effect.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Move your cursor around the screen and watch the eyes follow your movement.
4. Enjoy the interactive eyes exercise!

## Future Improvements

I would like to improve this in the future by changing the eyes to look more realistic.  This can be done by continuing to revise the styles CSS file.
